This project was part of a videocourse webpage, which was planned for www.easymatura.swiss. The project was abandoned after finishing the first prototype due to difficulties with merging the design made in webflow by Ramon Gloor and the actual website frontend. Due to a strict time plan we then decided to use No-Code tools to create our MVP (www.easymatura.swiss) and add the more flexible coded platform in a later stage. The project as is can be seen as very first prototype for a feasability study, which so far is some iterations away from production including refactoring, testing, documentation and combining with the design. Due to a lack of sales we do not plan to further persue this project right now.

An impression of the website capabilites so far can be seen on the following video made in november:
